        <p>
          2.In the event that you have huge loads of item photographs you want

        <p>
          You get to pick the completion time that turns out best for you. Our
          default completion time is 24 hours, yet when you redo and affirm your
          request, you can browse these times:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>6 hours</li>
          <li>12 hours</li>
          <li>24 hours</li>
          <li>48 hours</li>
          <li>96 hours</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The longer the turnaround time, the less the image-editing services
          will cost. If you’re working against a tight deadline, you can pay
          extra to have your images back in less than 24 hours.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not in a hurry? Pick a completion time more prominent than 24 hours
          and get a good deal on your request.
        </p>
